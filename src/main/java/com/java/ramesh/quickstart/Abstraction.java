    /*

    1. Interfaces can have only Abstract methods, where in Abstract can have non-abstract methods
    2. Variables in Interfaces are Final, where in Abstract class can have non-final variables
    3. Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables (Interfaces by default final and static variables)
    4. An interface can extend only another interface (wherein Abstract class can extend other classes and multiple interfaces)
    5. members in Interface are Public by default. Abstract class can have class members like private, protected etc.
